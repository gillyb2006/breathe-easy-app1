Breathe Easy: Your Air Quality Companion

This app provides real-time air quality data, empowering everyone to make informed decisions about their health and well-being.

    Data Fetching: The app connects to a database that stores the latest air quality readings from various monitoring stations.
    Data Processing: The app retrieves the readings, organizes them by time and location, and converts them into a user-friendly format.
    Visualization: The app creates an interactive line chart that displays the air quality data over time. This visual representation allows users to easily track changes in air quality and identify any trends or spikes.

    Decision Making: Users can use the app to make informed decisions about outdoor activities, especially during periods of poor air quality.
    Community Engagement: The app fosters a sense of community awareness about environmental issues and encourages residents to take action to improve air quality.

Future Features:

    Additional Data Points: Expand the app to include more air quality parameters, such as ozone levels and particulate matter.
    Location-Specific Data: Allow users to select specific monitoring stations to view more detailed data.
    Notifications: Implement a system to send notifications to users when air quality exceeds certain thresholds.

Let's Breathe Easy Together!
